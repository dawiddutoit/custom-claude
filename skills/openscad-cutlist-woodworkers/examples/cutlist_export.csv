# 2. Click "Import" → "CSV File"
# 3. Upload this file
# 4. Configure settings:
#    - Sheet size: 2440×1220mm (standard plywood)
#    - Blade thickness: 3mm (table saw kerf)
#    - Grain direction: Length (for plywood grain matching)
# 5. Click "Optimize"
#
# EXPECTED RESULTS:
# - Total panels: 10 unique parts (some with quantities >1)
# - 18mm panels: ~4.2 m² total area → 2-3 sheets of 2440×1220mm
# - 4mm panels: ~1.2 m² → 1 sheet of fiberboard
# - Edge banding: ~24.5m of 4mm ABS tape
#
# EDGE BANDING COLUMNS EXPLAINED:
# Edge1, Edge2, Edge3, Edge4 = thickness of edge banding on each edge (0 = none)
# Typically only 1-3 edges need banding (visible edges)
# Back/hidden edges = 0
#
# NOTES COLUMN:
# Use for grain direction, special instructions, or panel purpose
