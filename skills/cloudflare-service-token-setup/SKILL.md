# Service Token Setup Skill

Complete workflow for creating and managing Cloudflare Access service tokens for automated infrastructure verification and non-human access.

## Quick Start

Quick service token setup:

```bash
# 1. Create service token via Cloudflare dashboard
# Go to: https://one.dash.cloudflare.com → Access → Service Auth → Create Service Token
# Name: "Infrastructure Automation"
# Duration: 1 year

# 2. Add credentials to .env
echo "CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.access" >> /home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/.env
echo "CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret" >> /home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/.env

# 3. Test service token
source /home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/.env
curl -H "CF-Access-Client-Id: ${CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID}" \
     -H "CF-Access-Client-Secret: ${CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET}" \
     https://jaeger.temet.ai

# 4. Use helper script for testing
/home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/scripts/cf-service-token.sh test jaeger.temet.ai
```

## Instructions

### 3.1 Understanding Service Tokens vs OAuth

**Service Tokens (Non-Human Access):**
- For automation, scripts, monitoring systems
- Bypasses Google OAuth requirement
- Works with curl, scripts, CI/CD
- Long-lived (months/years)
- No user session required

**Google OAuth (Human Access):**
- For humans accessing via web browser
- Requires Google account login
- Session-based (24 hours default)
- Multi-factor authentication support

**When to use each:**

| Use Case | Method |
|----------|--------|
| Automated health checks | Service Token |
| CI/CD deployment verification | Service Token |
| Monitoring scripts | Service Token |
| Sharing verification with Claude | Service Token |
| Human web browser access | Google OAuth |
| Interactive service use | Google OAuth |

**Key difference:** Service tokens **automatically bypass** all Cloudflare Access policies - no additional configuration needed.

### 3.2 Create Service Token via Dashboard

**Step 1: Navigate to Service Auth**

1. Go to: https://one.dash.cloudflare.com
2. Navigate to: **Access** → **Service Auth** → **Service Tokens**
3. Click: **Create Service Token**

**Step 2: Configure Token**

- **Name:** `Infrastructure Automation` (or descriptive name)
- **Duration:** 1 year (or as needed)
- **Recommended:** Use descriptive names like "CI/CD Pipeline" or "Health Monitoring"

**Step 3: Save Credentials**

After creation, Cloudflare shows:
- **Client ID:** `8f0eb3c52a7236fc952d9b11cd67b960.access`
- **Client Secret:** `63b34062dbca3405521196952ba4d155...` (long hex string)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Client secret is shown **only once**. Copy it immediately.

**Step 4: Copy Credentials**

Copy both values - you'll add them to .env in the next step.

### 3.3 Add Credentials to .env

Add service token credentials to project .env file:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /home/dawiddutoit/projects/network

# Add credentials to .env
cat >> .env << 'EOF'

# Cloudflare Access Service Token (for automation)
CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id.access"
CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret-here"
EOF
```

**Replace values** with actual credentials from dashboard.

**Verify credentials added:**

```bash
grep CF_SERVICE_TOKEN /home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/.env
```

Expected output:
```
CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID="8f0eb3c52a7236fc952d9b11cd67b960.access"
CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET="63b34062dbca3405521196952ba4d155de00f59e52d0fa23d0a7f3de66696c6c"
```

**Security note:** .env is already in .gitignore, so credentials won't be committed.

### 3.4 Test Service Token Access

**Test with curl directly:**

```bash
# Load environment variables
source /home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/.env

# Test single service
curl -I \
  -H "CF-Access-Client-Id: ${CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID}" \
  -H "CF-Access-Client-Secret: ${CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET}" \
  https://jaeger.temet.ai
```

**Expected result:**
```
HTTP/2 200
server: Caddy
...
```

**Test multiple services:**

```bash
source /home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/.env

for service in pihole jaeger langfuse ha sprinkler code webhook; do
  echo "Testing ${service}.temet.ai..."
  status=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
    -H "CF-Access-Client-Id: ${CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID}" \
    -H "CF-Access-Client-Secret: ${CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET}" \
    "https://${service}.temet.ai")

  echo "  Status: HTTP $status"
  echo
done
```

**Success indicators:**
- HTTP 200: Service accessible and working
- HTTP 502: Service token working but backend down
- HTTP 403: Service token invalid or expired

### 3.5 Use Helper Script for Verification

The project includes a helper script for easier testing:

**Test single service:**

```bash
/home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/scripts/cf-service-token.sh test jaeger.temet.ai
```

Expected output:
```
Testing jaeger.temet.ai...
✓ Service token accepted (HTTP 200)
```

**Test with full response:**

```bash
/home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/scripts/cf-service-token.sh test jaeger.temet.ai --verbose
```

Shows complete HTTP response and headers.

**List all service tokens:**

```bash
/home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/scripts/cf-service-token.sh list
```

Shows all service tokens configured in your Cloudflare account.

**Test all configured services:**

```bash
for domain in pihole jaeger langfuse ha sprinkler code webhook; do
  /home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/scripts/cf-service-token.sh test ${domain}.temet.ai
done
```

### 3.6 Revoke or Rotate Service Token

**When to revoke:**
- Token compromised or exposed
- Token no longer needed
- Regular security rotation (annually recommended)

**Revoke via Dashboard:**

1. Go to: https://one.dash.cloudflare.com
2. Navigate to: **Access** → **Service Auth** → **Service Tokens**
3. Find token by name: "Infrastructure Automation"
4. Click trash icon → **Delete**
5. Confirm deletion

**Revoke via Script:**

```bash
# List tokens to get ID
/home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/scripts/cf-service-token.sh list

# Delete by ID
/home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/scripts/cf-service-token.sh delete <token-id>
```

**After revocation:**

1. Remove credentials from .env:
```bash
nano /home/dawiddutoit/projects/network/.env
# Delete CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID and CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET lines
```

2. If rotating (not removing), create new token and update .env with new credentials.

**Token rotation workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Create new token via dashboard
# 2. Add new credentials to .env (with new_ prefix temporarily)
echo "CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID_NEW=new-client-id.access" >> .env
echo "CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET_NEW=new-secret" >> .env

# 3. Test new token works
source .env
curl -H "CF-Access-Client-Id: ${CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID_NEW}" \
     -H "CF-Access-Client-Secret: ${CF_SERVICE_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET_NEW}" \
     https://jaeger.temet.ai

# 4. If working, replace old with new in .env
nano .env  # Remove old credentials, rename new_ to remove suffix

# 5. Revoke old token via dashboard
```

### 3.7 Monitor Service Token Usage

View service token access logs:

**Via Cloudflare Dashboard:**

1. Go to: https://one.dash.cloudflare.com
2. Navigate to: **Logs** → **Access**
3. Filter by: **Authentication method** → **Service token**
4. View:
   - Timestamp of access
   - Service accessed
   - Token name used
   - Source IP
   - Success/failure

**Log retention:** 30 days (free plan) to 6 months (enterprise)

**Monitoring for suspicious activity:**
- Unexpected IPs accessing services
- High frequency of requests (potential abuse)
- 403 errors (token may be expired/revoked)

**Alerts setup** (optional):

Set up Cloudflare Notifications:
1. Go to: Account → Notifications
2. Create alert for: Access events
3. Trigger: Service token authentication failures

## Supporting Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `references/reference.md` | Service token architecture, security best practices, API details |
| `scripts/test-service-token.sh` | Automated testing script for all services |
| `examples/examples.md` | Example use cases, monitoring scripts, CI/CD integration |

## Expected Outcomes

**Success:**
- Service token created in Cloudflare dashboard
- Credentials stored securely in .env
- Token bypasses OAuth for protected services
- HTTP 200 responses for accessible services
- Helper script works for verification
- Can share verification results with Claude

**Partial Success:**
- Token created but not tested (complete step 3.4)
- Some services return 502 (backend issue, not auth issue)

**Failure Indicators:**
- HTTP 403 responses (token invalid or not configured)
- Token not found in dashboard
- Credentials not in .env
- Helper script fails with "missing credentials"

## Requirements

- Cloudflare Zero Trust account with Access configured
- Admin access to Cloudflare dashboard
- .env file with write permissions
- curl installed for testing
- Existing Cloudflare Access applications configured

## Red Flags to Avoid

- [ ] Do not treat service tokens like passwords (they are powerful credentials)
- [ ] Do not share service tokens publicly or commit to git
- [ ] Do not create unlimited tokens (1-2 per use case is sufficient)
- [ ] Do not skip saving client secret immediately (shown only once)
- [ ] Do not use service tokens for human browser access (use OAuth)
- [ ] Do not forget to revoke tokens when no longer needed
- [ ] Do not ignore 403 errors (indicates auth failure, not backend issue)

## Notes

- Service tokens **automatically bypass** Cloudflare Access policies (no policy configuration needed)
- Token duration options: 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, no expiry
- Recommended duration: 1 year with annual rotation
- Service tokens work for all Access-protected applications automatically
- No limit on number of service tokens per account
- Revoked tokens fail immediately (no grace period)
- Service tokens don't support MFA (they bypass all human authentication)
- Use separate tokens for different systems (easier to revoke if compromised)
- Monitor Access logs regularly for unusual service token activity
- cf-service-token.sh script location: `scripts/cf-service-token.sh`
